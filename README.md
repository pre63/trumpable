http://trumpable.pre63.com/

## Features
* Trump's twitter steam
* Hillay's twitter stream
* Toggle boutton to switch between streams
* Background color is animated when fetching data source
* Real-time! well almost, every 10 seconds

## Stack
* React
* Redux
* Semantic UI
* cors-anywhere

## Limitation
Because the twitter data is scraped from the public page, only the last 20 tweets are displayed. It has the advantage to work without a backend to hide the twitter api credentials. I used cors-anywere demo for this, so the fetch could fail at any time, for like no reason. I'm sorry.
